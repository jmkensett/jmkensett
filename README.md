- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jmkensett (Matthew Kensett) 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an economist with interests in labour and public economics. I am particularly interested in the economics of inequality and climate change.  
- ğŸŒ± I am currently working on the distributional impacts of climate change policies on labour and financial markets, and in turn how households are impacted.
